# How to login into a Vyatta

Brocade NFV (Network Functions Virtualization) can be accessed using a web GUI or directly with an SSH login.

## Authenticate to SoftLayer's Private Network

1. Enter the private IP address from the **Details** screen (**Network > Gateway Appliances** menu) into your browser with an https:// prefix, (for example, https://10.54.207.131/). Be aware that you may receive a certificate error because the device does not use a public certificate. Accept the error to go to the webpage.

2. Enter the credentials from the **Password** tab located under the **Devices** menu in the Web Portal for the **vyatta** user.  You will land on the Brocade dashboard.
