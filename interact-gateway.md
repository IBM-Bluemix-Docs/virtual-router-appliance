# Interact with a Gateway in the Snapshot View

After accessing the Gateway Appliances screen in the Customer Portal users may quickly view and interact with a Gateway in its Snapshot View. This view provides direct access to a Gateway Appliances's associated VLANs. 

Perform the following procedure to interact with a Gateway in the Snapshot View:

1. Access the [Gateway Appliances screen](access-gateway-appliances.html) in the Customer Portal. 
2. Click the arrow to the left of the Gateway to expand into the Snapshot View.
3. Click any of the following Gateway Components to be directed to its associated screen.

Gateway Component |	Screen
----------------- | ------
Gateway |	Gateway Details Screen
Public VLAN |	VLAN Details screen for the Gateway's Public VLAN
Private VLAN |	VLAN Details screen for the Gateway's Private VLAN
Associated VLAN |	VLAN Details screen for the selected Associated VLAN

If you access a VLAN Details screen, refer to the [VLANs topic page](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/infrastructure/vlans/getting-started.html#get-started-with-vlans) for more information. If you access the Gateway Appliances Details screen, you can rename a gateway, or associate, disassociate, route or bypass a VLAN. In addition, bulk interactions may be taken on multiple VLANs using the Bulk Actions feature.
