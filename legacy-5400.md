# Vyatta 5400 Support

Legacy Vyatta 5400 customers should upgrade to IBM Virtual Router Appliance (VRA) as soon as possible, as Vyatta 5400 may no longer be supported as early as April 2018.

A migration guide is available [here](http://wpc.c320.edgecastcdn.net/00C320/Vyatta%205400%20to%20Virtual%20Router%20Appliance%20Upgrade%20Options.pdf).

For a detailed list of improvements that the VRA has over Vyatta 5400, refer to the [FAQs](faqs.html#what-improvements-does-the-virtual-router-appliance-vyatta-5600-have-over-the-vyatta-5400-).
