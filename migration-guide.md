# Migration Overview
{: #migration-overview}

Legacy Vyatta 5400 customers should migrate to IBMÂ© Virtual Router Appliance (VRA) as soon as possible, as support for Vyatta 5400 will be removed as of March 31, 2019.

## How Upgrading Can Benefit You

In addition to a variety of new features and capabilities that IBM's Virtual Router Appliance brings to the table, there are also a number of improvements it provides as well. Refer to our [FAQs](/docs/infrastructure/virtual-router-appliance?topic=virtual-router-appliance-faqs-for-ibm-virtual-router-appliance#what-improvements-does-the-virtual-router-appliance-vyatta-5600-have-over-the-vyatta-5400-) for more details.

Upgrading to a new device will have a different configuration from the Vyatta 5400. As a result, a Vyatta 5400 configuration (file) will not transfer to your new appliance.
