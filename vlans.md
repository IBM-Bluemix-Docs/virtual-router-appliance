# Routing Your VLANs
{: #routing-your-vlans}

The Virtual Router Appliance is able to route multiple VLANs over the same network interface (for example, `dp0bond0` or `dp0bond1`). This is accomplished by setting the switch port into trunk mode and configuring virtual interfaces (VIFs) on the device.

For example: â€¨

```
set interfaces bonding dp0bond0 vif 1432 address 10.0.10.1/24
set interfaces bonding dp0bond0 vif 1693 address 10.0.20.1/24
```

The commands above create two virtual interfaces on the `dp0bond0` interface. The interface `dp0bond0.1432` processes traffic for VLAN 1432 while the interface `dp0bond0.1693` processes traffic for VLAN 1693.
